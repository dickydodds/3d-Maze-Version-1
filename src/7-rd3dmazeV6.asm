;door exit animation
;the idea here is that the following will happen when you reach the exit:-
;    0 turn off the buffer screen via reg $69
;    1 draw a black box growing ever bigger to fill the screen - thats exit_anim routine
;    2 leave that screen on show
;    3 point to the buffer screen
;    4 draw the first screen of the next level - unless its the last level (level 255 when you finish the game!)    
;    5 copy the attributes to a place in memory - probably after the char screen at $c000
;    6 switch the buffer screen back on via reg $69
;    7 make all the buffer screen colours black
;    8 switch in the buffer screen
;    9 turn off the buffer screen because we want to see the colours materialise!
;    9 draw the colours back in from the copied colours earlier but from the outside in - new_maze_anim routine
;    10 go back to normal!

;LDI Performs a "LD (DE),(HL)", then increments DE and HL, and decrements BC.

;Now, on with the lesson. Aside from OTIR you can also unroll other things. INIR, LDIR and LDDR will also greatly benefit from this method, and sometimes it is also ;beneficial to unroll normal loops which use DJNZ, JR or JP.

;In the case of LDIR however, the number of loops is often too large to simply use an LDI that number of times. That would take up too much space. So what we can do ;instead is to unroll only part of the loop. Say, we need to LDIR something 256 (100H) times. Instead of LDIR we could write:

;we need to move 768 bytes = 48 x 16
