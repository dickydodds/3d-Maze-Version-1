# 3d-Maze-Version-1
ZX Spectrum Next 3d Maze based on the iconic ZX81 3D Monster Maze by Malcolm Evans and the port to the ZX Spectrum by Paul Farrow.

This is my first fully ZX Spectrum machine code game. It is NOT the game I intended to write. I wanted to do more than what this game provides but the character based display this is based upon deos not lend itself to the full 3d experience I had in mind! So that will be version 2 and will use the ZX spectrum Next layer 2 screen, so another huge learning curve!

As of now, November 2020, this program is not finished and is still a work in progress. I created this github repository to store mu code in case of loss and to make the game available to the world when it is completed :)
